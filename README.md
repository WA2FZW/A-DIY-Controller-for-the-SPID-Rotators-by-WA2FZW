# A-DIY-Controller-for-the-SPID-Rotators-by-WA2FZW

This is a DIY Controller which will work with many of the SPID rotators such as the SPID-RAK (azimuth only) or SPID-RAS (azimuth plus elevation).

The software allows the rotators to be controlled by the various computer programs commonly used such as N1MM Rotor, DxView, SatPC32, etc. Instead of using the poorly documented SPID controller protocol, it uses a subset of the Yaesu GS-232 protocol.

The software can be compiled for either the EL/AZ or AZ only configurations. The processor is the commonly available Arduino Mega 2560.

The hardware consists of the processor, a PCB for the controller itself, A power supply PCB and a switch panel. The power supply can be configured for either 12 or 15 volts.

I haven't priced it out in detail, but the total cost to build it is probably $200 or less; much cheaper than some of the commercially available controllers for the SPID rotators.
